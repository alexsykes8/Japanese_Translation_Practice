Welcome!

This is a project that makes learning Japanese easier. By using public domain novels, you can search for sentences that contain a particular word and that match your JLPT level. 
You can also add words outside the standard JLPT lists that you know so that you can customise the sentences that the program thinks you will be able to read.
